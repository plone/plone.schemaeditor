  [cedricmessiant]

  [davisp, cedricmessiant, thomasdesvenain at toulouse-sprint]

  among all registered vocabularies.
  We don't have an error anymore

  [thomasdesvenain]


1.3.3 (2013-08-13)
------------------

  We can add fieldsets to a schema.

  [ericof]


1.3.1 (2013-03-05)
------------------

- Quote attribute value in xtags attribute style jquery selector used
  in prepOverlay for field settings. Absence of quote was causing a js error
  on clicking "Settings in schema editor.
  [smcmahon]


1.3.0 (2013-01-17)
------------------

- Use a *set* of choice fields for the "multiple choice" field option in the UI,
  instead of a *list* of choice fields. The latter is orderable and is a less
  common use case (plus we need a better widget for it).
  [davisagli]

- Make it possible for schema contexts to restrict the fields that can be added
  by defining an allowedFields property.
  [davisagli]

- Add more specific events for when a field is added or removed.
  [davisagli]

- I18n improved by adding many missing strings

1.2.1 (2012-08-29)
------------------

* Use zope.lifecycleevent.
  [hannosch]

* The field edit form now respects autoform hints. Additional schemata can
  be provided by registering an adapter of the schema context and field to
  ``plone.schemaeditor.interfaces.IFieldEditorExtender``.
  [davisagli]


1.2.0 - 2012-02-20
------------------

* Display fields from behaviors in the schema preview too.
  [davisagli]

* Prevent the user from creating fields with names that are reserved for
  Dublin Core metadata. ``title`` and ``description`` can still be used
  as long as the fields are of the correct type.
  [davisagli]

* Remove unhelpful help text for min_length and max_length fields.
  [davisagli]

* The schema listing preview now respects autoform hints (such as custom
  widgets).
  [davisagli]

* Make new boolean fields use the radio widget by default. The field now
  appears as "Yes/No" in the list of field types.
  [davisagli]

* Hide the 'read only' setting for fields.
  [davisagli]

* Edit field defaults from the schema listing instead of in the field
  overlays. This simplifies making sure that the default can't be set
  to invalid values.
  [davisagli]

* Limit the height of text areas in the schema listing to avoid extra
  scrolling.
  [davisagli]

* Fall back to normal traversal if a field isn't found when traversing the
  schema context. This fixes inline validation for forms on the schema
  context.
  [davisagli]

* Make it possible to make the schemaeditor not be the default view of the
  schema context, by specifying the ``schemaEditorView`` attribute on the
  schema context.
  [davisagli]

* Added Spanish translation.
  [hvelarde]

1.1.2 - 2011-11-26
------------------

* Add .mo files which were missing in 1.1.1.
  [davisagli]

1.1.1 - 2011-11-26
------------------

* Added internationalization and extracted messages for main languages.
  [thomasdesvenain]

* Added French translation.
  [thomasdesvenain]

* Added Italian translation.
  [giacomos]

1.1 - 2011-09-24
----------------

* Avoid errors when expanding the range of `min` and `max` attributes on a
  field, and when entering a `default` outside the range.
  [davisagli]

* Validate input for the `default` attribute of Choice fields based on the
  field's vocabulary.
  [davisagli]

* Removed support for setting the `missing_value` attribute of fields through
  the web.
  [davisagli]

* Add a date-only field with no time component.
  [davisagli]

* Bugfix: Validate short names of fields.
  [davisagli]

1.0.3 - 2011-06-15
------------------

* Fix test.
  [davisagli]

1.0.2 - 2011-06-14
------------------

* Make FieldFactory do a deep copy of its arguments to avoid problems with
  mutable defaults getting shared between field instances.
  This fixes http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=133
  [davisagli]

* Remove dependency on zope.app.schema.
  [davisagli]

1.0.1 - 2011-05-20
------------------

* Relicense under the BSD license.
  See http://plone.org/foundation/materials/foundation-resolutions/plone-framework-components-relicensing-policy
  [davisagli]

* On multiple choice fields (List of Choice), read/write attributes other than
  ``values`` in the correct place (on the List rather than its value_type
  Choice).
  [davisagli]

* Remove unneeded dependency on plone.i18n.
  [davisagli]

1.0 - 2011-04-30
----------------

* In addition to the normal object events raised when fields are added, edited,
  and removed, raise a SchemaModifiedEvent on the schema context. This greatly
  simplifies writing code to serialize schema changes, and makes it possible to
  track of the schema origin so that we know where to serialize it.
  [davisagli]

* Support non-ASCII characters in vocabularies for Choice fields.
  [davisagli]

* Change js event used to dynamically set id from title from keyup to change;
  autocompletion does not raise a keyup event, but does fire change.
  [smcmahon]

* jslintify schemaeditor.js
  [smcmahon]

* Honor cancel button in field editor popup.
  [smcmahon]

1.0b2 - 2011-01-22
------------------

* Add another possible base to try for our fixed IDatetime, since
  plone.app.z3cform may change which one takes precedence.
  [davisagli]

* Default to adding Textline fields.
  [davisagli]

1.0b1 - 2010-04-18
------------------

* Added overlay support to the field edit screens.
  [davisagli, limi]

* Revamped UI to show WYSIWYG representation of fields.
  [davisagli, limi]

* Removed the JavascriptFormWrapper.
  [davisagli]

* Major package cleanup.
  [davisagli]

* Omit the 'required' and 'missing_value' fields for Bool fields.
  [davisagli]

* Add the ability to define vocabularies of simple TextLine values.
  Both single and multiple select fields are provided.
  [rossp]

* Override base field interfaces to get the correct field types for the default
  and missing_value fields, rather than using the MetaFieldWidgetFactory.
  [rossp]

* Make sure that normalized ids for new fields use _ instead of -, so that they
  can be accessed without using getattr.
  [davisagli]

* Fix issue with moving fields to position 0 in a schema.
  [davisagli]

* List the available field type vocabulary alphabetically.
  [davisagli]

* No longer provide a field factory for zope.schema.Bytes, since
  plone.namedfile provides a better file field and now registers its own field
  factories.
  [davisagli]

* Fix inline validation for the field edit form.
  [davisagli]

* Added ReadOnlySchemaListing for listing fields without making them editable.
  [davisagli]

* CSS tweaks
  [davisagli]


1.0a2 - 2009-07-12
------------------

* Changed API methods and arguments to mixedCase to be more consistent with
  the rest of Zope. This is a non-backwards-compatible change. Our profuse
  apologies, but it's now or never. :-/

  If you find that you get import errors or unknown keyword arguments in your
  code, please change names from foo_bar too fooBar, e.g. add_field() becomes
  addField().
  [optilude]

1.0a1 - 2009-05-23
------------------

* Initial release

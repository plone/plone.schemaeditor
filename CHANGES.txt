Changelog
=========

1.1 - 2011-09-24
----------------

* Avoid errors when expanding the range of `min` and `max` attributes on a
  field, and when entering a `default` outside the range.
  [davisagli]

* Validate input for the `default` attribute of Choice fields based on the
  field's vocabulary.
  [davisagli]

* Removed support for setting the `missing_value` attribute of fields through
  the web.
  [davisagli]

* Add a date-only field with no time component.
  [davisagli]

* Bugfix: Validate short names of fields.
  [davisagli]

1.0.3 - 2011-06-15
------------------

* Fix test.
  [davisagli]

1.0.2 - 2011-06-14
------------------

* Make FieldFactory do a deep copy of its arguments to avoid problems with
  mutable defaults getting shared between field instances.
  This fixes http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=133
  [davisagli]

* Remove dependency on zope.app.schema.
  [davisagli]

1.0.1 - 2011-05-20
------------------

* Relicense under the BSD license.
  See http://plone.org/foundation/materials/foundation-resolutions/plone-framework-components-relicensing-policy
  [davisagli]

* On multiple choice fields (List of Choice), read/write attributes other than
  ``values`` in the correct place (on the List rather than its value_type
  Choice).
  [davisagli]

* Remove unneeded dependency on plone.i18n.
  [davisagli]

1.0 - 2011-04-30
----------------

* In addition to the normal object events raised when fields are added, edited,
  and removed, raise a SchemaModifiedEvent on the schema context. This greatly
  simplifies writing code to serialize schema changes, and makes it possible to
  track of the schema origin so that we know where to serialize it.
  [davisagli]

* Support non-ASCII characters in vocabularies for Choice fields.
  [davisagli]

* Change js event used to dynamically set id from title from keyup to change;
  autocompletion does not raise a keyup event, but does fire change.
  [smcmahon]

* jslintify schemaeditor.js
  [smcmahon]

* Honor cancel button in field editor popup.
  [smcmahon]

1.0b2 - 2011-01-22
------------------

* Add another possible base to try for our fixed IDatetime, since
  plone.app.z3cform may change which one takes precedence.
  [davisagli]

* Default to adding Textline fields.
  [davisagli]

1.0b1 - 2010-04-18
------------------

* Added overlay support to the field edit screens.
  [davisagli, limi]

* Revamped UI to show WYSIWYG representation of fields.
  [davisagli, limi]

* Removed the JavascriptFormWrapper.
  [davisagli]

* Major package cleanup.
  [davisagli]

* Omit the 'required' and 'missing_value' fields for Bool fields.
  [davisagli]

* Add the ability to define vocabularies of simple TextLine values.
  Both single and multiple select fields are provided.
  [rossp]

* Override base field interfaces to get the correct field types for the default
  and missing_value fields, rather than using the MetaFieldWidgetFactory.
  [rossp]

* Make sure that normalized ids for new fields use _ instead of -, so that they
  can be accessed without using getattr.
  [davisagli]

* Fix issue with moving fields to position 0 in a schema.
  [davisagli]

* List the available field type vocabulary alphabetically.
  [davisagli]

* No longer provide a field factory for zope.schema.Bytes, since
  plone.namedfile provides a better file field and now registers its own field
  factories.
  [davisagli]

* Fix inline validation for the field edit form.
  [davisagli]

* Added ReadOnlySchemaListing for listing fields without making them editable.
  [davisagli]

* CSS tweaks
  [davisagli]


1.0a2 - 2009-07-12
------------------

* Changed API methods and arguments to mixedCase to be more consistent with
  the rest of Zope. This is a non-backwards-compatible change. Our profuse
  apologies, but it's now or never. :-/
  
  If you find that you get import errors or unknown keyword arguments in your
  code, please change names from foo_bar too fooBar, e.g. add_field() becomes
  addField().
  [optilude]

1.0a1 - 2009-05-23
------------------

* Initial release

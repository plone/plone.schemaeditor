Introduction
============

plone.schemaeditor provides a through-the-web interface for modifying Zope 3
schemata (interfaces).

Currently there is support for:

* adding and removing fields
* editing attributes of existing fields
* reordering fields
* renaming fields
* organizing fields into fieldsets

plone.schemaeditor only handles the actual schema editing.  To be useful, it
requires some integration code to take care of the following pieces:

* traversing to a schema that is used as the context of the editor
* persisting schema changes across Zope restarts

See plone.app.dexterity (along with plone.dexterity and plone.supermodel) for
one approach to this integration.

The following field types (from zope.schema) are currently supported:

* TextLine
* Text
* Int
* Float
* Bool
* Password
* Datetime
* Choice (with simple list of values)
* List of Choice (with simple list of values)

Third-party packages can make additional field types available by registering
new IFieldFactory utilities.

Dependencies
============

* Zope 2
* z3c.form
* plone.z3cform
